SSL/TLS Certificates

When an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificate is created for a domain by a CA (Certificate Authority), CA's take part in what's called "Certificate Transparency (CT) logs". These are publicly accessible logs of every SSL/TLS certificate created for a domain name. The purpose of Certificate Transparency logs is to stop malicious and accidentally made certificates from being used. We can use this service to our advantage to discover subdomains belonging to a domain, sites like https://crt.sh and https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui offer a searchable database of certificates that shows current and historical results.



------------------------------------------------------Go to crt.sh and search for the domain name tryhackme.com, find the entry that was logged at 2020-12-26 and enter the domain below to answer the question.

Search Engines

Search engines contain trillions of links to more than a billion websites, which can be an excellent resource for finding new subdomains. Using advanced search methods on websites like Google, such as the site: filter, can narrow the search results. For example, site:*.domain.com -site:www.domain.com would only contain results leading to the domain name domain.com but exclude any links to www.domain.com; therefore, it shows us only subdomain names belonging to domain.com.



---------------------------------Go to Google and use the search term site:*.tryhackme.com -site:www.tryhackme.com, which should reveal a subdomain for tryhackme.com; use that subdomain to answer the question below.
